This project is a simple Python application designed to manage products. It allows adding, retrieving, and deleting products. Additionally, the project includes automated unit and integration tests using pytest to ensure that the functionality works correctly. A key feature is the integration of the testing process with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI), allowing automated testing to run on every code push or pull request.
